What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
  If we increase the number of hidden nodes :- Accuracy will be increase.
                                               complex patterns and rellationship in the data also increases.
                                               also if we increas the number of hidden nodes too much can also lead to overfitting.

Can you explain the pattern of accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
  if we increase the number of hidden nodes the pattern where accuracy initialy increas until a point where it starts to decrease due to  overfitting.
